My game should have three things.
A state.
A screen.
A user input watcher thing.



The screen should listen for the state to change.
It should redraw then, or every 60s check state and draw yourself
The user inputer watches for various inputs, and relays that to the state

Next Updates 
The ground and tool system is happening and is encapsulated. 
I want to move into "luring" animals to be in your "garden"
How can i make animals cute?
